# Turf Central
##  A Full Stack Python Soccer Turf booking application.

### About this project
Currently this project is in it's very nascent stages. I have planned to implement the backend in Python and FastAPI.
I am eagerly looking for backend and frontend devs to collaborate on this project. Please let me know if you are willing to collaborate, and I will be happy to discuss a collaborative workflow.

### Current goals
- Ability to register, login and authenticate using token-based authentication (Currently thinking of using FastAPI's built-in Oauth2 support for this)
- Admin backend to manage available soccer turfs
- User backend endpoints to list(paginated, ofc) nearby soccer turfs, and make bookings
- Database structure for ideal performance under heavy system stress

### Future goals
- Dockerize this shit lmao
- Take some time to sincerely pay attention to docs and make them easy to understand(Not a current goal as I want to get the backend up and running asap first)
- Think of cool ideas(Honestly, it seems that the cool ideas might be more applicable on the front-end side, eg: Map-view for nearby soccer turfs)
- Ideally, a payment gateway implementation for making bookings
- A mobile app implementation
